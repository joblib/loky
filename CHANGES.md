### 2.3.2dev0 - In development

- Improve reporting of causes in python2.7 (#174)

- Improve workers crash reporting by displaying the exitcodes of
  workers in `TerminatedWorkerError` (#173)

- Add a `wrap_non_picklable_objects` decorator in `loky` to make it
  easy to fix serialization failure for nested functions defined in
  the `__main__` module. (#171)

### 2.3.1 - 2018-09-13 - Bug fix release

- Improve error reporting when a worker process is terminated abruptly
  (#169).

- Remove spurious debug output.

### 2.3.0 - 2018-09-05 - Release highlights

- Add support for PyPy3.

- `loky.cpu_count()` is now upper-bounded by the value of the
  `LOKY_MAX_CPU_COUNT` environment variable (when defined).

- Fix issue #165 to make `loky.cpu_count()` return an integer under
  Python 2.7 with fractional docker CPU usage quotas.


### 2.2.2 - 2018-08-30 - Bug fix release

- Add a `set_start_method` function in `loky.backend.context`. Note
  that now, `loky` does not respect the start method set using
  `multiprocessing.set_start_method` anymore. It is thus mandatory
  to use the `loky` function to have the correct behavior.


### 2.2.1 - 2018-08-27 - Bug fix release

- Fix pickling logic in loky. Now the serialization is consistent
  between initializer and tasks. Also fixes the logic behind the
  environment variable `LOKY_PICKLER`.

- Improve reporting for tasks unpickling errors.

- Fix deadlock when large objects are sent to workers.

- Fix context and `start_method` logic for loky contexts.


### 2.2.0 - 2018-08-01 - Release Highlights

- Add a protection against memory-leaks for long running worker
  processes: if the memory usage has increased by more than 100 MB
  (after a garbage collection), the worker is automatically restarted
  before accepting new tasks. This protection is only active when psutil
  is installed.

- psutil is now a soft-dependency of loky: it is used to recursively
  terminate children processes when available but there is a fallback
  for windows and all unices with pgrep installed otherwise.

### 2.1.4 - 2018-06-29 - Bug fix release

- Fix win32 failure to kill worker process with taskkill returning 255
- Fix all error at pickle raise PicklingError
- Add missing license file

### 2.1.3 - 2018-06-20 - Release Highlights

- Fix bad interaction between `max_workers=None` and `reuse='auto'` (#132).
- Add initializer for `get_reusable_executor` (#134)

### 2.1.2 - 2018-06-04 - Release Highligths

- Fix terminate for nested processes
- Fix support for windows freezed application
- Fix some internal API inconsistencies

### 2.1.1 - 2018-04-13 - Bug fix release

- Fix interpreter shutdown
- Fix queue size in reusable executor
- Accelerate executor shutdown

### 2.1.0 - 2018-04-11 - Release Highlights

- Add documentation, accessible on http://loky.readthedocs.io
- Fixed a thread-safety issue when iterating over the dict of processes in
  `ReusablePoolExecutor._resize` and `ProcessPoolExecutor.shutdown`.

### 2.0 - 2018-03-15 - Release highlights

- Add `loky.cpu_count` that returns the number of CPUs the current process can
  use. This value is now used by default by `ProcessPoolExecutor`.  (#114).
- Add `__version__` field in the `loky` module (#110).
- Fix multiple instabilities and simplify the inner mechanisms (#105, #107).

### 1.2.2 - 2018-02-19 - Bug fix release

- Fix handling of Full Queue exception at shutdown time. (#107).

### 1.2.1 - 2017-10-13 - Bug fix release

- Fix a potential deadlock when shutting down a past reusable executor instance
  with to create a new instance with different parameters. (#101, #102)

### 1.2 - 2017-09-12 - Release highlights

- Rename `loky.process_executor.BrokenExecutor` as `loky.BrokenProcessPool` and
  subclass `concurrent.futures.process.BrokenProcessPool` when available to make
  except statements forward compatible.

### 1.1.4 - 2017-08-08 - Bug fix release

- Fix crash for 64-bit Python under Windows.
- Fix race condition in Queue Manager thread under Python 3.4+

### 1.1.2 - 2017-07-03 - Bug fix release

- Fix shutdown with exit at pickle deadlock
- Fix LokyProcess spawning forcing context to be loky in child (necessary for joblib)

### 1.1.1 - 2017-07-28 - Bug fix release

- Fix default backend for ReusablePoolExecutor

### 1.1 - 2017-07-28 - Release higlights

- Rename `loky` backend to `loky_init_main`.
- New `loky` backend which makes it possible to use `loky` with no `if __name__ == '__main__':` safeguard.
- Change the default backend to `loky`.
- Fix deadlocks on `PocessPoolExecutor.shutdown` (#71, #75)


### 1.0 - 2017-06-20 - Release highlights

- Make `ProcessPoolExecutor` use a spawn-based start method by default. The
  `fork`-based start method is not longer officially supported.
- Fixed a race condition at executor shutdown


### 0.3 - 2017-06-02 - Release highlights

- Basic handling of nested parallel calls up to recursion depth 3 (by default, can be changd by setting LOKY_MAX_DEPTH)
- Various internal code clean-up and test improvments


### 0.2 - 2017-03-24 - Release highlights

- Customizable serialization (#46)
- Add support for calling dynamically defined function when cloudpickle is available (#47)
- Fix resizing of the executor (#51)
- Various rare race condition fixes
