### 2.2.0dev0 (in development)

- Add a protection against memory-leaks for long running worker
  processes: if the memory usage has increased by more than 100 MB
  (after a garbage collection), the worker is automatically restarted
  before accepting new tasks. This protection is only active when psutil
  is installed.

### 1.0 - 2017-06-20 - Release highlights

- Make `ProcessPoolExecutor` use a spawn-based start method by default. The
  `fork`-based start method is not longer officially supported.
- Fixed a race condition at executor shutdown
